A cash offer is an all-cash bid to purchase a property, indicating that the buyer has the funds available to buy the home outright, without the need for mortgage financing. This type of offer can be particularly attractive to sellers as it eliminates the risk of buyer financing fall-through and can offer a quicker closing process.

Different **house buying companies** may specialize in various types of properties or offer unique services. For instance, some might focus on luxury properties, while others are known for purchasing investment properties.
