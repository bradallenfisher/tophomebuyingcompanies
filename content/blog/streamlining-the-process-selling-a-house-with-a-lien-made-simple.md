### Judgment Liens

**Judgment liens** arise when a court grants a creditor the right to place a lien on your property due to an unpaid debt.

### Mortgage Liens

A **mortgage lien** is a type of voluntary lien where the lender has a claim to the home until the property owner pays off the mortgage in full.

### Property Tax Liens

Should you fail to **pay property tax**, the local government may **place a lien** on the property until the debt is cleared.

### Release of Liens

A **release of lien** is a document that shows that the lien has been satisfied and is no longer a claim against the property.

### Paying off a Lien

To **pay off the lien**, the property owner must settle the debt. Only then can the **lien be released**.

### Removing a Lien

To **remove a lien**, you may either pay the debt in full, **dispute the lien** in court if it’s unwarranted, or reach an agreement with the lien holder.
